# Displaying-Employees-Info

This program displays three Employee's info. The Employee's class is an abstract class. There are three sub classes: FulltimeEmployee, 
ParttimeEmployee and SalariedEmployee. For now i have all classes in one file. Later on i will try to brake them up and have them in 
seperate files. 

So the SalariedEmployee is a Full time worker that has yearly salary that increases at a rate of 7 percent. Full time employess get 
overtime pay for the hours they work since they dont have fix salaries, with over 40 hours per week at a rate of 1.5 times their hourly pay
rate.
